## Andre Ribeiro 

I'm SRE / DevOps Engineer with a strong focus on *Observability* and *OpenTelemetry*.  
I enjoy understanding how systems behave under the hood, turning signals into insight, and improving reliability through automation.

I work daily with *cloud environments, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure automation, currently I mainly use **Python* and *Node.js*.  
Past experience includes *C, C++, PHP, and Bash*, which helps me reason about systems beyond abstractions.

Reliability starts when systems are observable.
