## Andre Ribeiro 

I'm SRE / DevOps Engineer with a strong focus on **Observability** and **OpenTelemetry**.  
I enjoy understanding how systems behave under the hood, turning signals into insight, and improving reliability through automation.

I work daily with **cloud environments, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure automation**. Currently I mainly use **Python** and **Node.js**.
Past experience includes **C, C++, PHP, and Bash**, which helps me reason about systems beyond abstractions.

**Reliability starts when systems are observable.**
